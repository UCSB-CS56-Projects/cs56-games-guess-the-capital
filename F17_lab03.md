a) It is a game where a player picks the correct capital and then receives a score.

b) As a student, I can play this game to learn the capitol of various different countries and states. I can learn capitals in the US to
  prepare for a geography test.

c) The program runs and allows for a player to play the game. It is played from the command line. Players can choose if they want
  to pick the capital of the country or state of their choice. Players can also choose how many questions they want. After playing,
  they are told their score.

d) As a Pokemon fan, I could be quizzed on Pokemon instead of capitals. As an elderly person, I could use a graphical interface so
that my eyes do not have to strain trying to read the command line.

e) The README.md could better explain how the files relate to each other. Such as the files with all the states or capitals and how
those files are used in the rest of the program. Images of the game at play would explain the concept of the game well.

f) There are commented out lines that had been planned for future use. These can be removed.

g) There are enough issues to earn 1000 points. The issues are clear.

h) No additional issues.

i) The program is separated into many individual files with their own class. Each file has a very specific purpose, making
implementing changes less confusing. Everything is well defined with comments. It is somewhat clear how everything relates to
each other. If I was getting someone up to speed quickly, I would describe which class is essential to which part of the game.

j) I could not find any test files with JUnit tests in them.
