(a) The game is a multiple choice command line game where the user has to guess the capital of the state/country correctly given 1 correct choice and 3 random choices. The player can earn points by answering questions correctly.

(b) As a User I can answer a question correctly so that I earn Points.

(c) The software does indeed run and each game mode works correctly. There are four game modes with two that deal with US state capitals and two that deal with world capitals.

(d) As a User I want to be able to test myself with a mixture of US state capitals and world capitals so that I can test all of my knowledge at once.
    As a User I want to be able to pick how many questions I answer so that 
    As a User I want to be able to use a leaderboard so that I know my highscore

(e) The build.xml file can be cleaned up as Github can replace the publish and download targets. The compile target seems self-explantory but it could use a brief description. The jar target can also use a brief description.

(f) The current issues are very straightforward and most of the issues can be solved quickly and efficiently. The hardest issues to tackle would be creating a GUI for the game and refactoring the code to make it more efficient. We believe that there are not enough issues as of now to earn 1000 points.

(g) As the project is relatively simple and straightforward, any issues we have coincide with the current issues from the repo. One other issue is that there are text files that are copies and are stored in another directory which are not used.
