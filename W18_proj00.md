(a) A game that let player guess the captials of some countries and eventually get a score.

(b)As a user, I can start a game so that I can start guess the captials.
  As a user, I can see my scores so that I know how I did on the game.
  As a user, I can see the history high score so that I know how good or bad I am.

(c) It runs. It pop out an option to chose which area do you like to guess ( such as North America, Africa, Asia...). After you chose, game start and you can play it and after you finish all the questions the program will give you your score and show you the history high score.

(d)As a user, I can play the game with real time limits so that if I didn't answer in time limits, I  fail on that question.
   As a user, I can know the right answer after I finish it so that I know where I made mistake.
   As a user, I can add different languages so that people who speak different language can also play   this game.
   As a user, I can add Latin Capitals database so that there's something more to play.
   As a user, I can create seperate highest score database so that players can clearly see the results.

(e)It would be great to present where are the problems that are unsolved and add some comments that how does the database store.

(f) The project has build.xml. By typing 'ant test' in the command line, the compiler will run JUnit test to test the functionality of the class. By typing 'ant run', user can run the class and begin to play the game. Currently, we did not find any JWS stuff that needs to be removed.

(g) I believe so. Most of them are.

(h) right answer not shown; Asia data base exists but not working. 

(i) First of all, the storage method of database and java-related documents is terrible.It is extremely hard for new begineer to find what they need. The naming method of files in this project is also terrible, as it is hard to guess the purpose of the file through file name. Besides, the acctual storage file names are different from what listed in README.md. The relation between classes is not so clear. Inside the files, however, codes and comments are pretty clear.
  If I write "one screenful of text" to help other coders understand this project, I will first include a brief demonstration about the rule of this game and how it works. Then I will include the how the data of this project organized and basic functionality of the most important files. 

(j)The project does not have any test at all. In README.md, previous coder mentioned that there is GameTest.java, but we did not find it. It is necessary to expand the test coverage of the project, at least to some important features of the project.
